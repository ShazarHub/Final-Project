# Final-Project-

## Presentation (SEGMENT 1)

### Selected Topic: Auto Insurance Claims
### Reasons Why: From, https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/, "Insurance fraud steals at least $80 billion every year from American consumers. (Coalition Against Insurance Fraud is working to update this figure in 2022)."
### Source Data: From Kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data
### Questions to Answer: 

#### Exploratory Data Analysis Questions (Dashboards, i.e. Tableau/PowerPoint)

- Average months as a customer?
- Average age of customers?
- Policy annual premiums between genders? Between ages?
- Incident severity between genders? Between ages?
- Location based insurance statistics
- Bias in claims per input feature such as auto make and model

#### Machine Learning Questions

- What input features provide the greatest determination in insurance fraud detection?
- Which machine learning model will be most appropriate for a dataset of 40 columns with varying data types?
- Will our insurance dataset need binning for categorical values that have a large number of unique values?
- Are the categorical variables' unique values distributed relatively evenly?

## GitHub Protocol

### Communication: Slack, GitBash comments, and GitHub request comments.

### Individal Branches: One branch for each team member:
- Team Members are: Jason Mueller, Shazar Satar , and Derek Huggens.
- Each team member must have at least four commits for the duration of each segment.

## Machine Learning Model

### Team members must present a provisional machine learning model that stands for the final machine learning model with the following abilities:
- Takes in data from the provisional database.
- Outputs label(s) for the input data.

## Database

### Team members must present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
- Sample data mimics the expected final database structure or schema.
- The draft machine learning model is connceted to the provisional database.
